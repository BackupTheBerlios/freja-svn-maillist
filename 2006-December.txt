Subject: [Freja-svn] link suggestion - blog banned by Google
Message-ID: <002c01c48942$f97f14e5$0ffe0838@wkjifqqp>

Hi. My name is Eugene Gershin. Perhaps we have met online, but more probably you don't know me from Adam. I monitor blogs for SamsonBlinded, and came across your post.
 
I'd like to welcome you to look at Obadiah Shoher's blog. Obadiah - an anonymous Israeli politician - writes extremely controversial articles about Israel, the Middle East politics, and terrorism.  
Shoher is equally critical of Jewish and Muslim myths, and advocates political rationalism instead of moralizing. 
Google banned our site from the AdWords, Yahoo blocked most pages, and Amazon deleted all reviews of Obadiah's book, Samson Blinded: A Machiavellian Perspective on the Middle East Conflict.
Nevertheless, 170,000 people from 78 countries read the book.
 
Various Internet providers ban us periodically, but you can look up the site on search engines. The mirror www.samsonbllinded.com/blog currently works.
 
Please help us spread Obadiah's message, and mention the blog in one of your posts, or link to us from csscripting.com/freja. I would greatly appreciate your comments.
 
Best wishes,
Eugene Gershin
